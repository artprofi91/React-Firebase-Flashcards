# React-Firebase-Flashcards
Most of us have one or two areas of knowledge that we strive to know very well â€” things related to our jobs, of course, and maybe a hobby or two. I really enjoy knowing something new every day. I built a flash-card application using React and Firebase. This app helps me to study Italian. The first time I visited Italy in 2005 and since then I have fallen in love with this country. 
<br>
The basis for my application was ([Wes Doyle Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKCAtlsn1Eo&t=2432s)).

# How app works

![react](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28790452/29590911-dc06a938-8761-11e7-894b-fe3752f4f114.gif)

<br>
In this case, I store in Firebase 10 flashcards with English and Italian words. When you open a website you can see a flashcard with an English word and should try to remember it's meaning in Italian.
<br> 
If you can not remember the word translation or you want to check yourself you can hover the cursor on the card and you will see the reverse of the card with Italian word's translation.
<br>
Next step you may click "Draw card" button to see the next word in the random order.
